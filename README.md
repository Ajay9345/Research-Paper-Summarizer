#Research Paper Summarizer Crew

An AI-powered multi-agent system that automatically analyzes and summarizes research papers using CrewAI + Groq LLM.

This system helps students and researchers quickly understand academic papers without reading 20–30 pages manually.

##Problem Statement

Students and researchers spend hours reading research papers to understand:

Methodology
Model architecture
Results
Limitations
Future work
This project automates that process using a multi-agent AI architecture.
