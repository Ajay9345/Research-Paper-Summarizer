Research Paper Summarizer Crew

AI-powered multi-agent system that automatically analyzes and summarizes research papers using CrewAI + Groq LLM.

This system helps students and researchers quickly understand academic papers without reading 20–30 pages manually.

Problem Statement

Students and researchers spend hours reading research papers to understand:

Methodology

Model Architecture

Results

Limitations

Future Work

Reading and manually extracting these sections from long academic PDFs is time-consuming and inefficient.

Solution Overview

This project automates the research paper understanding process using a multi-agent AI architecture.

How It Works

User uploads a research paper (PDF).

The system extracts text from the PDF.

Multiple CrewAI agents analyze different parts of the paper.

The system generates a structured academic summary.

Users can ask questions using interactive Q&A mode.
